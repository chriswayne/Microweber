Version : 1.0
Release Date : 2006/01/18
Description :
    By using this plugin, you will be able to insert a portion of code in your
    article (or any document edited with tinyMCE)
    The source code will be auto-highlighted using the PHP library Geshi
    (see Credits) (code indentation, keywords highlighting, etc..)

What do I need to run this? :
    * PHP
    * Geshi Library on your site

Limitations :
    * Not XHTML Compliant (due to Geshi)
    * The <pre> tag is recognized as a bit of code
    * Makes use of XMLHTTPRequest : some browser won't be able to run it
    * Lack of translation
           (en,fr,fr_ca... can you help me? if so, contact me, thx)
    * Hopefully that's all but if you find other issues, please let me know
      and I'll try to fix it.

Credits :
    I'd like to thank Nigel McNie <nigel *AT* geshi *DOT* org> for his

          in your tinyMCE config
        or
        - append the contents of /insertcode.css to your
          tinyMCE content CSS file
